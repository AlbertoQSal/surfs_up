# Surfs Up

## Overview: 
### Introduction: 

W. Avy and I are planning to open up a surf shop and an ice cream shop, so we decided to make and analysis to understand the weather in Hawaii and decide if this plan will fit our expectations and will be sustainable all year around. In order to understand the weather we decided to make two analysis, the first one retrieves the data from the temperature in June, and the second one retrieves the temperature in December, this to understand the weather in summer and winter in Hawaii.

## Results:
### June Temperature Analysis:
During the month of June the mean temperature was 74.944118 Fahrenheit degrees, with a minimum temperature of 64 °F and a maximum temperature of 85 °F. The statistical analysis is shown in the figure bellow.

### December Temperature Analysis:
During the month of December the mean temperature was 71.041529 Fahrenheit degrees, with a minimum temperature of 56 °F and a maximum temperature of 83 °F. The statistical analysis is shown in the figure bellow.

Figure 2. December Temperatures.

### Conclusions: 
Overall, the three main points that we conclude with the analysis are:
  * The difference between the average temperature of June and December is only about 3 °F, so this could suggest that the temperature is suitable to invest in an Ice Cream shop.
  * In December, the lowest registered temperature was 56 °F so this could mean that at certain days it would be necessary to implement special equipment in the Surf shop and that the sales in the  Ice Cream shop could fall in those days, so it would be necessaty to think in possible solutions or products that could be sell to overcome the drop on the sales.
  * In Figure 1 and 2, we can see that the differences between the analysis of temperature of June and December are minimal so a bussines like the one we are propossing is suitable if we only analyze the environmental factors.

## Summary

The results shown above give us proofs that the climate is adequate for a bussines like the one we are proposing. Of course, some strategies will need to be taken when the weather conditions aren't ideal. The mean temperature between June and December is 72.9928235 °F or 22.7737 °C, this temperature is more than enough to support a Surf and Ice Cream shop and with an adequate bussines strategy it could generate very good profits.

Another factor that is important to consider is the amount of rain in each month, so we can understand the behavior of the rain in summer and winter. In order to obtain this informatin we performed two more queries to determine the mean values of cubic inches of rain that falled at each seasson.

The general results are:

Figure 4. December Precipitation.

With the mean value of each table we can see that in December there is a mean precipitation of 0.216819 cubic inches, meaning that even though the amount of precipitation is small is a factor that needs to be considered, because in December the temperature drops and the raining increases this could lead us to a problem that would need to be solve.
